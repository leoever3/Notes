### Database System

#### Database

* Databases evolved from **computer file systems**
* Data is managed most **efficiently** when using database
* Evolution: File cabinet -> computer tape -> disk
* **Database**: shared integrated computer structure that stores a collection of
  * End-eser data
  * **Metadata**: data about data



#### Database management system (DBMS)

* Implements a database and manages its contents
* Manages structure and controls access to data
* DBMS is the **intermediary** between the user and database

* DBMS present database to end user as single repository
* Advantages: sharing, security, integration, inconsistency, access, decision making



#### Data VS Information

* Data is raw facts.
* Information is the result of processing raw data to reveal meaning



#### Type of Database

* Single-user/Multiuser
* Centralized/Distributed
* Unstructured data/Structured data/Semistructured data



#### File System

* Requires extensive programming
* Cannot perform **ad hoc** quries
* System administration is complex and difficult
* **Difficult to make changes** to existing structures
* **Security** features are likely to be inadequate



#### Problems

* **Data redundancy**: same data stored unnecessarily in different places

* **Data inconsistency**: different and conficting versions of same data occur at different places
* **Data anomalies**: abnormalities when all changes in redundant data are not made correctly
  * update anomalies
  * insertion anomalies
  * deletion anomalies



#### Design database

* **Data modeling skills** defines the database structure
* Well-designed database facilitates data management and generates valuale information



#### Environment

* Hardware
* Software
* People
* Procedures
* Data



#### Functions

* Data dictionary management
* Data storage management
* Data transformation and presentation
* Security management
* Multiuser access control
* Backup and recovery
* Data integrity management
* Access languages and application programming interfaces 
  * SQL -- nonprocedural
* Database communication interface
