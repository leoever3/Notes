### Entity Relationship model

* Uses **ERD** to represent conceptual database as viewed by end user
* Based on Business rules

#### Components

* Entities (table) --- entity set
* Attributes --- characteristics of entities
  * Multivalued attributes: have many values
  * Divided attributes

* Relationships: association between entities

#### Chen Model & Crow's Foot Model



#### Connectivity and Cardinality notation

* **Connectivity**: describe the relationship classification
* **Cardinality**: minimum and maximum number of entity



#### Relationship type

* **Existence dependence**
  * Existence dependence: Entity exists in database only when it is associated with another related entity occurrence
  * Existence independence

* **Relationship Strength**
  * Weak relationship
  * Strong relationship: PK of related entity contains PK component of **parent entity**

* **Weak Entities**
  * Existence depenent
  * PK partially or totally derived from parent entity in a relationship (Strong relationship)

* **Participation**
  * Optional
  * Mandatory: must at least be one

#### Relationship degree

* Unary relationship. (Recursive relationships)
* Binary relationship
* Ternary relationship (3 entities)

* Associative(Composite) Entities
  * M:N must be mapped to a  set of 1:M relationship



#### UML

* UML class diagrams are used to represent static data structures in a data model



### Developing an ER Diagram

* iterative process
* make design compromises
