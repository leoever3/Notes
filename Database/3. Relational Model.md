### Relational Model

| Relation Model | Relational database |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| Relation       | Table               |
| Tupel          | Row                 |
| Attribute      | Column              |
| Domain         | Datatype            |

#### Table

* **Relation** thought of as a table
* Tables are basic building. blockes of a relational database
* Table: two dimensional structure composed of rows and columns
* Each table row represents a single **entity occurrence**



#### Key

* Keys are central to the use of relational tables
* Each row in a table must be **uniquely identifiable**
* **Key: one or more attributes that determine other attributes**

##### Types of key

Composite key: more than one **attribute**

Key attribute: any attribute that is part of a key

* Superkey: any key that **uniquely identifies** each row
* Candidate key: a superkey without unnecessary attributes
* **Primary key**: A candidate key selected (cannot be null)
* Secondary key: used strictly for data retrival purposes
* **Foreign key**: match the primary key in **another table**/bu null
  * Using FK to control **data redundancies**

Each table row must have a primary key that uniquely identifies all attributes

##### Nulls

* Unknown

##### Integrity

* Entity integrity: each row is unique
* Referential integrity: each FK has a corresponding value in the PK table



#### Relational algebra operators:

* SELECT
* PROJECT: select specific column
* JOIN
* INTERSECT: common row
* UNION: union two sets
* DIFFERENCE: different row
* PRODUCT: *
* DIVIDE

#### SQL

* SQL -- **Structured Query Language**
* SLECT INSERT UPDATE DELETE



#### Data dictionary & System catalog

* Metadata

#### Relationships

* 1:M
* 1:1
* M:N ---> 2 * 1:M

#### Index

* Orderly arrangement to logical access rows in a table
* Index key
* Unique index
