SQL run as an Interpreter.

- [**Compiler**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler): A compiler is a computer program (or set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language, often having a binary form known as object code).
- [**Interpreter**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language): An interpreted language is a programming language in which programs are 'indirectly' executed ("interpreted") by an interpreter program. This can be contrasted with a compiled language which is converted into machine code and then 'directly' executed by the host CPU.
