### Normalization

* Normalization **minimizes data redendancies**
* **3NF** is as high as needed



#### 1NF

* All key attributes are defined
* No repeating groups
* All remaining attributes are dependent on PK



#### 2NF

* 1NF 
* No **partial dependencies**   by making new tables
  * No attribute is dependent on only portion of PK
  * X -> Z (X, Y is PK)



#### 3NF

* 2NF
* No **transitive dependencies**
  * X -> Y, Y -> Z (X is PK)



#### BCNF

* Boyce-Codd Normal Form
* 3NF
* Every determinant in table is a candidate key





#### 4NF

* 3NF
* No multivalued sets of multivalued dependencies
  * All attributes dependent on PK, independent of each other
  * No row contains two or more multivalued fact about an entity



#### Denormalization

* Tables are sometimes denormalized to yield less I/O, which increases processing speed
