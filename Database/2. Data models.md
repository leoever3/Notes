### Data model

* Model: an **abstraction** of a real world object or event
* A **data model** is an abstraction of a complex real-world data environment.
* Components:
  * **Entities** (Employee)
  * **Attributes**  (employee number/name)
  * **Relationships**   (1:M) (M:N) (1:1)
  * **Constraints**



#### Business rules

* Business rules identify and define basic modeling components
  * One deparment has many employees
* **Translating** business rules into data model components



#### The evolution of Data Model

1. Hierarchical model: 
   * up-down tree

2. Network data model
   * May have more than one parent
   * concepts
     * **Scheme**: conceptual organization of entire database as viewed by the database administrator
     * Data management language(**DML**)
     * Data definition language(**DDL**)

3. **Relational model** 1970
   * Table(relations)
   * Mattrix consisting of **row/column**
   * **SQL**
   * **Entity relationship model** introduced by Chen
   * **Entity relationship diagram (ERD)** Graphic represemtation

4. Object-oriented (OO) data model
   * Data and relationships are contianed in **object**
   * **UML**

5. Extended relational data model (ERDM)
   * (Extensible Markup Language)**XML**
6. Big Data and **NoSQL**



#### Data Abstraction

* External
  * End user's view
  * External schema: entities relationships process constraints

* Conceptual
  * ERD

* Internal/Logical
  * Depends on specific database software
  * seen by the DBMS
* Physical model
