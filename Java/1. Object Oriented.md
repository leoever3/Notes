### Class and Objects

```java
public class Car {
    private String model;				//Global varible
    private int milesDriven;
    
    public Car (String model, int miles) {		// Constructor
        this.model = model;
        milesDriven = miles;
    }
    
    public boolean isRichkid() {
        String expensiveBrand = new String();			//Local variable
        expensiveBrand = "Bugatti";
        if (model.equalsIgnoreCase(expensiveBrand)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

#### Constructor

* A Java constructor is **special method that is called when an object is instantiated**.
* Every class has at least one constructor. In the case no constructor is declared, the compiler will automatically insert a **defalt** no-argument constructor.
* keywords: **this() / super()**

* **super()** is a statement that explicitly calls a parent constructor and may inly be used in the first line.

#### Static

* Static makes the variable/method shared among all instances of class.
* Only one single instance of static variable/method exists in JVM.

#### Naming Conventions

* **Class** name must start with **Capital** letter.

* **Object** name must start with **lowercase**.

* **Package** names are all **lowercase**.

* **Variable** must start with lowercase 

  except final static constant: 

  ```
  public static final Sting ADDRESS = "192.168.1.1";
  ```

### Encapsulation and Access Control

#### Access control

#### Encapsulation

* Usually all instance variables are defined as **private** amd we use **getter/setter** to access them.
* Getter/setters hides the unsafe access to the class variables/fields..

### Inheritance

* Inheritance defines a relationship between classes with common attributes.
* Inheritance facilitates **code reuse**, and result in code that is more **readable** and **maintainable**.
* Super class VS sub class
* kewords: **extends**	

```java
public class ElectricCar extends Car{}
```

* A subclass inherits everything of its superclass and adds some new attributes or methods.
* **Overriding**: @Override A subclass can provide a new definition to a method that it inherits.

### Polymorphism

* Polymorphism is a programming language feature that allows values of different data types to be handled using a uniform interface.

```java
Car newCar = new ElectricCar("Tesla",9899);
```

* Is-a relationship

#### Overriding VS Overloading

* **Overloading**: same class name but different parameters

* **Overriding**: same signature but one method in superclass the other in subclass.
* **final** method can't be overriden

#### Downcasting and Upcasting

* Upcasting is always allowed

```Java
Parent p = new Child();
```

* Downcasting may throw "**ClassCastException**"

### Abstraction

Abstraction is the procees of hiding implementation details from the users.

#### Abstract class

* An abstract class c**an not be instantiated**. But its inherited class can.
* An abstract class/method can **not be private or final**.
* A non-abstract child class that extends an abstract method must implement all of its method without exception.
* An abstract class can contain non-abstract methods. But a non-abstract class cannot contain abstract method.

#### Interface

* All variables in the interface should be defined as **static** and **final**.
* All methods in the interface should be **public** and **abstract**
* Interface can not be instantiated and have no constructor.
* Keywords: **implements**
* A class cna implements more than one interfaces.
